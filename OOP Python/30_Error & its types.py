# Error means mistake.Generally in programming it is two types.

# 1.Syntax Error
# It occurs when we will not follow proper syntax and rule regulation provided by python.
# Programmer is responsible for Syntax Error.

# print('Hello Python)
# l=[10,20,30,40
# d={1:'one',2:'two'
# a=10
# if a==10
#     print('a is 10')

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2.Run Time Error(Exception)
# If an error will occur at execution time then that type of error is called as Run Time Error.
# This error occur at the program execution because of several reasons like-
# 1.user provided input, 2.memory issues, 3.at the time of accessing data, 4.at the time of file opening

# l=[10,20,30,40,50]
# print(l[3])
# print(l[99])  # IndexError: list index out of range

# print('1')
# print('2')
# print('3')
# print(10/'sonu')  # unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'int' and 'str'
# print('4')
# print('5')
